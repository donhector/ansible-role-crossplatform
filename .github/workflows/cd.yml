      # Release to Github
      #############################

      # Since this repo follows the conventional commits specification,
      # we can use the 'semantic-release' toolset for automatic tagging/releasing
      # Instead of setting up the runner with node, then npm install semantic-release
      # and friends, then run it with npx, etc... we opted for a handy github action.
      # This gh action comes with some plugins pre-installed by default, but not
      # the one that provides the 'conventionalcommits' preset. Additionally, it does not
      # come with the plugins for creating a changelog and commiting it inot the repo.
      # Therefore we need to install those 3 extra plugins.
      # NOTE: The configuration file for 'semantic-release' is '.releaserc.yml'
